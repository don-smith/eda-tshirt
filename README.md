# EDA t-shirts

The idea is to have some code on the new EDA t-shirts currently being designed. Inspired my [@ahdinosaur](https://github.com/ahdinosaur)'s [dishwashing instructions](dishwashing-instructions.jpg) and the little snippet below that [@don-smith](https://github.com/don-smith) did for an EDA ad image, the idea is that this code should be relevant to the EDA experience.

This is just a first draft and definitely too much. What should we add/remove? Please send pull requests!


Another example of _cute code_:
